# Generative design

In this repository you will see some cases of AI-based generative design. It might not be possible without contribution of powerful library for computational engineering [PicoGK](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK) by [Leap71](https://leap71.com/).

# Getting started

## Installation

To install this project and start to use it you should do the following steps:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 following [this tutorial](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/blob/main/Documentation/VisualStudio_FirstTime.md)
2. Clone this repository to some directory on your machine. Now it is how your project folder looks like

3. Download PicoGK installer from [here](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/releases) (.exe file) and run it. Here you must choose some folder:

6. Almost done! Now everything you need is installed, so you can try to test some functionalities. Open project with Visual Studio selecting the GenerativeDesign.sln file and run it. If pop-up window with something that seems like a strange car is appeared, than everything is alright.
