# Generative design

In this repository you will see some cases of AI-based generative design. It might not be possible without contribution of powerful library for computational engineering [PicoGK](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK) by [Leap71](https://leap71.com/).

# Getting started

## Installation

To install this project and start to use it you should do the following steps:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 following [this tutorial](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/blob/main/Documentation/VisualStudio_FirstTime.md)
2. Clone this repository to some directory on your machine. Now it is how your project folder looks like
    
    ![Untitled](Generative%20design%20193f4f22485e4bec9432c4dcbf29a39e/Untitled.png)
    
3. Install this packages using [Nuget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio):
    - Microsoft.CodeAnalysis
    - Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp
4. Download PicoGK installer from [here](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/releases) (.exe file) and run it. Here you must choose some folder:
    
    ![Untitled](Generative%20design%20193f4f22485e4bec9432c4dcbf29a39e/Untitled%201.png)
    
5. Open the folder from step 3. You should see the same picture
    
    ![Untitled](Generative%20design%20193f4f22485e4bec9432c4dcbf29a39e/Untitled%202.png)
    
6. Select all files from PicoGK Example folder except PicoGK Example.csproj and Program.cs and copy them to your project folder. Then it should looks like this
    
    ![Untitled](Generative%20design%20193f4f22485e4bec9432c4dcbf29a39e/Untitled%203.png)
    
7. Almost done! Now everything you need is installed, so you can try to test some functionalities. Open project with Visual Studio selecting the GenerativeDesign.sln file and run it. If pop-up window with something that seems like a strange car is appeared, than everything is alright.
    
    ![Untitled](Generative%20design%20193f4f22485e4bec9432c4dcbf29a39e/Untitled%204.png)
    
    If picture on your screen is different (perhaps the window is dark), [this tutorial](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/blob/main/Documentation/README.md#troubleshooting) can help you with troubleshooting.
    

## Dataset

Dataset of carâ€™s generation code is available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/evgmaslov/gen_cars). There are a few steps of how to download and use it:

1. Run script load_dataset.py using command line. Pass pass of where to save dataset as the argument. Create dataset beyond the project directory in order to avoid problems with compilations. If you use bash write this from the first directory beyond project directory:
    
    ```bash
    python3 generative_design/load_dataset.py CarsDataset
    ```
    
2. Open GenerativeDesign/Launcher.cs file and change dataset_path and n_samples local variables with you values of dataset path and number of samples to show

3. Replace code in Program.cs file with this code:
    
    ```csharp
    using GenerativeDesign;
    try
    {
        PicoGK.Library.Go(0.5f, Launcher.SampleFromDataset);
    }
    
    catch (Exception e)
    {
    	// Apparently something went wrong, output here
    	Console.WriteLine(e);
    }
    ```
    
4. Run solution. If everything is correct, you will see random car samples:
